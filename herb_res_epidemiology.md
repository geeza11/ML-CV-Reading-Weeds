# Overview

The paper argues that epidemiology, which employs extent, distribution and determinants of a harmful organism/condition, could contribute to the management of herbicide resistance. The field would contribute to the understanding of emergence, selection and spread of herbicide resistance. To achieve these benefits there would need to be widescale and systematic collection of data on:

* weed abundance
* distribution
* frequency/mechanisms of resistance
* agronomic/environmental metadata

This information would assist in the development of statistical models that evaluate the relationships between each of these elements. With the overarching view provided by epidemiology, the large scale drivers of resistance (mechanism, ecology, evolutionary) would become more clear.

### Epidemiology

It looks beyond the single cases of resistance/disease in isolation and instead takes a large-scale systematic approach to:

* surveillance of target organism
* collection of appropriate and standardised metadata
* statistical analyses to identify relationships

### Application to Weeds

Weeds species are typically easy to locate/identify and methods exist to allow systematic spatial monitoring at large scales. They are mostly static, so field management histories can be used to infer selection pressure on the population in that field.
