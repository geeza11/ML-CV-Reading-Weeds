# Overview

Changed the thinking around low dose application of herbicides

A very well done piece of research - pressure on the findings to make change and be under the microscope.

### Materials and Methods

VLR population - critical thing was selecting a population that had never been exposed to herbicides. Directly or indirectly - either through herbicide application or gene flow. Even roadside plants may have experienced gene flow from paddock plants that have received a herbicide dose.

Ryegrass is an obligate outcrossing species, so genetic variability is high in the population.

Recommended rate for diclofop in Australia (375 g ha-1) is about half the global recommended rate (750 gha-1).

Screen VLR1 - collected survivors and the bulked them - put together to cross pollinate. By crossing them together there's an increased chance of having tolerance genes.

### Results

Figure 1: First selection - a 10th of the recommended rate. It poses the question - why isn't there just a rate where all the plants are dead - why is there a curve? The paper provides some of the answer: not all plants react the same way to that herbicide treatment. Every individual has a different level of tolerance to that herbicide. Which implies there are a whole range of genes that confer tolerance to that herbicide and therefore the genetic diversity suggests that resistance could develop.

Figure 2: Second selection - the curve wasn't as steep, suggesting more resistance present. The standard error bars indicate that there's significant variation in the population.

Figure 3: Shows the development of resistance based on the selection pressure. The population that survived the full field rate in the third year showed strong levels of resistance.

Outcrossing, strong pressure and low rates were critical in the development of resistance. Nonetheless, the original population is only 100 individuals a significant genetic bottleneck in the process.

Sensitivity of ACCase - no change --> it wasn't a genetic change to that enzyme. Ruled out a target site mutation.

### Conclusions

Low dose selection does lead to rapid evolutionary resistance. This is most likely what happened in Australian wheatbelt. A polygenic trait with P450 enzymes.

Because we were using such a marginal rate of diclofop, the plants may not even see that full rate and therefore inadvertently be exposed to lower rates. Low dose selection pressure may always be there in the field - particularly with residual herbicides the risk is even greater.
